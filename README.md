## Description
This is a learning project made to better understand python web frameworks and complex server setups. There will be multiple implementations of the same [basic interface](#waves), each using a separate [framework](#frameworks) (python or maybe other in the future). These implementations will be united using a complex [server setup](#server-setup).
