## Description
This is a learning project made to better understand python web frameworks and complex server setups. There will be multiple implementations of the same [basic interface](#waves), each using a separate [framework](#frameworks) (python or maybe other in the future). These implementations will be united using a complex [server setup](#server-setup).

## Waves
Each implementation will be done in waves and tagged along the way for easier navigation. Each wave requires implementing a part of the basic interface. *Wave will be described in full after any implementation reaches the previous wave*

### W1
- Basic Configuration
- Simplest Endpoint(s)
- X-Framework header for all requests
- Error handlers (404, 500)
