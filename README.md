*Inspired by local memes*

## Description
This is a learning project made to better understand python web frameworks and complex server setups. There will be multiple implementations of the same [basic interface](#waves), each using a separate [framework](#frameworks) (python or maybe other in the future). These implementations will be united using a complex [server setup](#server-setup).

## Waves
Each implementation will be done in waves and tagged along the way for easier navigation. Each wave requires implementing a part of the basic interface. *Wave will be described in full after any implementation reaches the previous wave*

### W1
- Basic Configuration
- Simplest Endpoint(s)
- X-Framework header for all requests
- Error handlers (404, 500)

### W2

### W3

### W4

## Frameworks
### Flask [F]
*Codename F, the sixth letter from micro-Framework*

### Flask + Flask-RESTX [R]
*Codename R, the sixth letter from the library name*

### Flask + Flask-Fullstack [X]
*Codename X, in honour of [xi.effect](https://github.com/xieffect)*

### Falcon [B]
*Codename B, because [falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon) is a Bird...*

### FastAPI [P]
*Codename P, because performance, I guess*

### Might be added
- Tornado
- Pyramid
- Dash
- Django RF
- Node.js
